# File-Hider

This is a simple python script that hides some files in a tree of subdirectories.

# Usage:
- Install the newest version of Python 3 from [the website](https://www.python.org).
- Be sure that you install pip while going through the Python installer.
- Run the command `pip install english_words`
- The script has to be in the same directory that contains the folder "Files" which contains the files to be hidden.
- Run the script by using the command `python file_hider.py` or `python3 file_hider.py` (whatever works)
- The files should be hidden and a new folder should have appeared containing all of the hidden files.
